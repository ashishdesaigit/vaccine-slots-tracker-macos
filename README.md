# vaccine-slots-tracker-macos

NOTE : Works only for macos

- git clone
- npm install
- edit sh file with pincodes of your choice
- edit sleep time as per API rate limiting, I would prefer 10 seconds delay
- `./track-vaccine-slots.sh` on your terminal. And continue your day to day work, In case it finds any slots you will receive macos notification in right corner.


### Script original idea credit - `https://gitlab.com/bhattankitk/cowin-vaccine-tracker`
I changed JS file and some minor changes in sh script.
